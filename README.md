This software is designed to track population flow within a space by allowing users to check in and out, and managers to customize the software for specific-tailored needs, such as a customizable User-Agreement-Page for new users.
Designed mainly for use in the MEK Senior Design Lab and MEB Machine Shop at the University of Utah.
